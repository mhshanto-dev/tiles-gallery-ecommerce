**Frontend Framework:** Next.js / React (for fast, SEO-friendly rendering)
**Authentication:** Firebase Auth or NextAuth.js (as seen with the "Logout" and "My Profile" features).
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for the responsive grid layout and modern hero section).
User Authentication: Since the "Logout" button and profile picture are visible, your project requires a Backend/Database (MongoDB) to store user sessions.
